            "Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful": "Even though Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful won't be as strong as it could have been without the rule change, it is still one of the best one-drop commanders ever printed. With more and more cheap legendary permanents printed every year, and a decent number of those being already available, it will regularly outperform other low-cost aggressive commanders, even with an average draw. Therefore, we've decided to ban Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful in order to maintain diversity among aggressive strategies."
