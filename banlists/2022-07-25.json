            "Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes": "<p>Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes is not about what makes a good or bad experience. It's not about building decks with an obliterating fast commander live. It's not about being a planeswalker as a commander. It's not about its colours. It's not about the extra card draws. It's not about the oppression of a super-early-blitz to mid-turns-targeted commander. It's not about commander-centric experiences. It's not about \"respond or die\" experiences. It's not about fighting 4/4 or 7/7 hasty, trampling creatures.</p><p>Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes is about all of that, at the same time. Which makes it quite hard to evaluate. This is the first time we face all those aspects accumulated, in a way that can be handled (Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes saw countless winsâ€¦ And defeats). But the sum of all nuisances is indeed very often a higher nuisance. Which is why, after debating over those aspects and many more we decided to ban Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes as a commander.</p>"
